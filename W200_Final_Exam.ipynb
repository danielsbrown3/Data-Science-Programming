I used these functions to add new columns for gene names, clinical significance (CLNSIG), and diseases to the DataFrame. I defined dangerous mutations as those that were either Pathogenic or Likely Pathogenic. Finally, I printed the total count of these harmful mutations, displayed the first 100 entries, and provided a count of each type of clinical significance among them. This gave a good overview of the data relevant to assessing genetic risks. Mutations classified as Benign, Likely Benign, or Uncertain Significance were not included in this count as I assumed they were not dangerous. There was a total count of 18,582 dangerous mutations, with 12,313 pathogenic and 6,269 likely pathogenic mutations identified.
